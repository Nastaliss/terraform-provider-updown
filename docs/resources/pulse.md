# updown_pulse (Resource)

`updown_pulse` defines a pulse (heartbeat) check for monitoring scheduled jobs and cron tasks.

Pulse checks are used to monitor scheduled jobs, cron tasks, or any periodic process. Instead of updown.io polling a URL, your job sends a heartbeat (HTTP POST) to updown.io after each successful run. If the heartbeat is not received within the expected period, updown.io will alert you.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Monitor a daily backup job
resource "updown_pulse" "backup_job" {
  alias   = "nightly-backup"
  period  = 86400  # expect heartbeat every 24 hours
  enabled = true

  recipients = [
    "email:123456789"
  ]
}

# Output the URL to use in your cron job
output "backup_heartbeat_url" {
  value       = updown_pulse.backup_job.pulse_url
  description = "POST to this URL after successful backup"
}

# Monitor a job that runs every 5 minutes
resource "updown_pulse" "frequent_job" {
  alias  = "data-sync"
  period = 300  # expect heartbeat every 5 minutes
}
```

### Using the Pulse URL

After creating the resource, use the `pulse_url` output in your scheduled job:

```bash
# Example: Add to your cron job or script
curl -X POST "${PULSE_URL}"

# Or with wget
wget --post-data="" "${PULSE_URL}"
```

## Schema

### Required

- **period** (Number) Expected interval in seconds between heartbeats (15 to 2678400, i.e., 15 seconds to 31 days).

### Optional

- **alias** (String) Human readable name for the pulse check.
- **apdex_t** (Number) APDEX threshold in seconds (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 or 8.0).
- **enabled** (Boolean) Is the check enabled (true or false).
- **mute_until** (String) Mute notifications until given time, accepts a time, 'recovery' or 'forever'.
- **published** (Boolean) Shall the status page be public (true or false).
- **recipients** (Set of String) Selected alert recipients. It's an array of recipient IDs you can get from the recipients API.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource (same as the check token).
- **pulse_url** (String) The URL to POST heartbeats to. Your scheduled job should POST to this URL on each successful run.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The check_id is basically whatever 4 characters you have after https://updown.io/
# It looks like the following regexp : ^https:\/\/updown.io\/([a-z0-9]{4})$

terraform import updown_pulse.my_job <check_id>
```
